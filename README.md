# hello-world-again
I'd written this code for the techgig goddess competition. Only one test case was successfully tested. 
The code requires you to give the maximum characters occuring in the string. The number of strings have to be inputted by the user. Following are the limits.
1<=number of strings inputted<=10
The string can have upto 100000 characters.
Any changes, corrections or improvements are welcome.
